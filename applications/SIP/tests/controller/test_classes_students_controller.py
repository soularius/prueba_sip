    Test suite for the ClassesStudentsController in the SIP application.

    This class provides unit tests for the ClassesStudentsController. It focuses on ensuring

        setUp(): Configures the mock environment before each test.
        test_index(): Tests the index method of the ClassesStudentsController.
