    Test suite for the DayOfWeeksController in the SIP application.

    This class provides unit tests for the DayOfWeeksController, focusing on ensuring

    and web2py components like Request, Session, Response, and SQLFORM.

    Methods:
        setUp(): Sets up the mock environment before each test.
        test_index(): Tests the index method of the DayOfWeeksController.
